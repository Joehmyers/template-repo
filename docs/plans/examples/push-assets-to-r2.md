# Plan: Push created assets to Cloudflare R2 by default

> **Status:** Done

## Overview

The repo can pull project data down from R2 (`ops/fetch-data.sh`) but has no upload path, so
anything created locally stays local. Add the symmetric push side: a `./assets/` directory
convention for created assets, an `ops/push-assets.sh` script that syncs it to the R2 bucket,
and a Claude Code `Stop` hook that runs the script automatically at the end of every agent
turn — so created assets land in R2 by default and are accessible from any machine. The hook
runs the script in `--auto` mode, which exits silently when R2 is not configured, the AWS CLI
is missing, or there is nothing to push, so fresh clones of the template are unaffected.

## Steps

- [x] 1. Create `ops/push-assets.sh` — mirrors `ops/fetch-data.sh` (loads `.env`, validates
       `R2_*` vars, `aws s3 sync` with the R2 endpoint and checksum workarounds). Uploads
       `ASSETS_DIR` (default `./assets`) to `s3://$R2_BUCKET/<prefix>` (default prefix
       `assets`, override via arg or `R2_ASSETS_PREFIX`). Never passes `--delete`. Supports
       `--auto` (graceful no-op used by the hook).
- [x] 2. Register a `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json` running
       `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/ops/push-assets.sh --auto` (explicit 120s timeout).
- [x] 2b. Harden for auto-run via hook (from adversarial review): parse `.env` for the
       expected keys instead of sourcing it (no arbitrary code execution, no leaking
       unrelated secrets into the `aws` process, env vars genuinely take precedence);
       `--no-follow-symlinks` and exclude `.env*` / `*.pem` / `*.key` so secrets can't be
       auto-exfiltrated; anchor a relative `ASSETS_DIR` to the repo root (hook cwd is not
       guaranteed); never exit 2 from the hook path (exit 2 from `aws s3 sync` would block
       the session from stopping); fail fast in `--auto` mode (`AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS=2`,
       `--cli-connect-timeout 5`) so a degraded network can't stall every turn.
- [x] 3. Add `assets/` to `.gitignore`; document `R2_ASSETS_PREFIX` / `ASSETS_DIR` in
       `.env.example`.
- [x] 4. Document the convention in `CLAUDE.md` (Commands, Environment/gotchas) and
       `README.md` (Getting started).
- [x] 5. Verify: `bash -n` / shellcheck both scripts; exercise `--auto` no-op paths and a
       stubbed end-to-end sync (fake `aws` on `PATH`).
- [x] 6. Commit: `push created assets to Cloudflare R2 by default`

## Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ops/push-assets.sh` | New — sync `./assets` up to R2 (manual + `--auto` hook mode) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | New `Stop` hook: auto-push assets after each agent turn |
| `.gitignore` | Ignore `assets/` |
| `.env.example` | Document `R2_ASSETS_PREFIX`, `ASSETS_DIR` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Commands entry + gotchas note for the auto-push hook |
| `README.md` | Mention the assets convention in Getting started |

## Verification

```bash
bash -n ops/push-assets.sh
shellcheck ops/push-assets.sh   # if installed

# Hook mode is a silent no-op without config
ops/push-assets.sh --auto; echo "exit=$?"

# Manual mode fails loudly without config
ops/push-assets.sh || true

# End-to-end with a stubbed aws CLI (asserts the sync command line)
# — see the fake-aws harness used during development
```
