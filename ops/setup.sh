# A cloud or web agent session starts from a bare clone with no dependencies
# installed, so it cannot run your tests and has to guess whether a change

# Usage:
#   ops/setup.sh          Install dependencies; fail loudly if something breaks.
#   ops/setup.sh --auto   Hook mode: exit 0 silently when nothing is configured.

# fresh clone of this template does nothing and reports nothing. The
